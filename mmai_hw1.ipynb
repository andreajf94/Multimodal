                "- Accurately delineate tumor boundaries in 3D brain MRI volumes\n",

                "- Dice coefficient: Gold standard for medical segmentation; handles class imbalance; can also serve as loss function\n",
                "- IoU (Jaccard): Stricter than Dice; widely used in computer vision; complements Dice\n",
                "- Sensitivity (recall): Clinically critical \u2014 missing a tumour is dangerous\n",
                "- Specificity: Ensures we don't over-predict; maintains radiologist trust\n",
                "- Precision: Measures reliability of positive predictions\n",
                "\n",
                "2. Other metrics considered:\n",
                "- Hausdorff distance: Measures worst-case boundary error; useful but expensive and outlier-sensitive\n",
                "- Average surface distance: More robust than Hausdorff; plan to add later\n",
                "- Volumetric similarity: Simple volume comparison but ignores spatial overlap\n",
                "- Pixel accuracy: Not informative due to severe class imbalance (~99% background)\n",
                "- AUC-ROC: Useful for probability outputs, but we do binary segmentation\n",
                "\n",
                "3. Pros and cons:\n",
                "- Dice: \u2705 Standard, comparable to literature, differentiable | \u274c Unstable for very small tumours, doesn't separate error types\n",
                "- IoU: \u2705 Intuitive, stricter than Dice | \u274c Values look lower, same small-object issue\n",
                "- Sensitivity: \u2705 Critical safety metric | \u274c Can be trivially maximised by predicting everything as tumour\n",
                "- Specificity: \u2705 Controls false alarms | \u274c Inflated when background dominates\n",
                "- Precision: \u2705 Measures trustworthiness | \u274c Low for aggressive models, threshold-sensitive\n",
                "\n",
                "Together these give a balanced picture: Dice/IoU for overall quality, sensitivity for safety, precision for reliability, specificity for false-alarm control."

Each sequence is a different \"view\" of the same brain \u2014 FLAIR suppresses fluid to reveal lesions, T1-GD lights up active tumour via contrast agent, and BRAVO provides fine structural detail. Seeing these modalities side by side makes it clear why multimodal learning matters: no single sequence tells the full story.\n",

Medical imaging data lives in specialised formats (NIfTI), behind cloud storage systems (Azure Blob), with large file sizes and varying intensity ranges. The key insight was to build a modular pipeline (download \u2192 load \u2192 normalise \u2192 extract slices \u2192 visualise) so each step could be tested and debugged independently.\n",

                "Weaknesses: 156 patients is moderate (will need augmentation or transfer learning), single institution (potential scanner/protocol bias), severe class imbalance, no uncertainty information on annotations.\n",
                "Overall: high-quality for learning and initial development, but would need multi-institutional supplementation for clinical deployment."
